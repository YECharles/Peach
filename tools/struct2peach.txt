
struct2peach
============

This is a simple Perl script that will convert C header files or 
010 Templates into Peach data models.  Currently there is support for
most basic types, simple arrays, structures, typedefs, structs in structs,'
and #defines.

When a type is not known a comment is placed for review.

NOTE:  This tool is intended to help speed up fuzzer creation for complex
formats, but manual fixups and editing is still required.

Known limitations
-----------------

 * No support for unions
 * No support for enums
 * No support for following #include statements
