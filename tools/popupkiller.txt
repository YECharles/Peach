
Peach Popup-Killer/Logger
=========================

The Peach Popup-Kill/Logger is a windows tool to close dialog boxes or
windows with the option to save the text of the window.

The popup-killer is configured by modifying the array located towards
the top of the popupkiller.py file.  Through this array one is able to
list the following fields:

 Window Title      - Title of the window/dialog to close
 Text to find      - Text located in the window/dialog to find.  This
                     is used when dialogs have generic names (like Alert)
                     but you only want a specific instance.  There are
                     limitations to what text we can locate.  If Spy++
                     can see it, so can this tool.
 Button to click   - Name of the button to click, or if None we will send
                     the WM_CLOSE message to the window/dialog.
 Save              - True to save contents of dialog.

Example:

#	  Window Title, 							Text to find,		Button to click, 		SaveAssert],
	[ 'Microsoft Visual C++ Debug Library',		'isctype.c',		'Ignore',				False ],
	[ 'Microsoft Visual C++ Debug Library', 	'Run-Time Check',	'Ignore',				True ],
	[ 'Alert',									None,				None,					False ],
	]
