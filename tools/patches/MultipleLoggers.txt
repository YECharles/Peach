I was tooling around with adding a custom Logger class, 
and found that Peach did not seem to support using 
multiple Loggers in the same Run.  Basically, I wanted 
to keep the built-in Filesystem Logger, but also have 
Peach simultaneously use my custom Logger.  To enable 
this behavior, I made some very minor changes to 
engine.py and dom.py (see attached patch file).
