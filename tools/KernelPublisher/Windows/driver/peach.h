Module Name:

    PEACH.H

Abstract:

    Defines the IOCTL codes that will be used by this driver.  The IOCTL code
    contains a command identifier, plus other information about the device,
    the type of access with which the file must have been opened,
    and the type of buffering.

Environment:

    Kernel mode only.
