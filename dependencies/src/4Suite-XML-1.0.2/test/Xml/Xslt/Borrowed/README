xbel-1.0.xsl
============

This comes from http://cscene.org/%7ejh/xml/bookmarks/, a very nice collection of Python and other tools for manipulating XBEL bookmark files.

Note that the XBEL distributed with the default Python XML-SIG distro is broken.  Apply ns_parse.py.patch to fix escaping of reserved XML characters such as "&" in XBEL attributes (at least for Netscape)
