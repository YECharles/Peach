    <function public="yes" name="Match" id="Match">
      <abstract>The regexp:match function lets you get hold of the substrings of the
string passed as the first argument that match the captured parts of
the regular expression passed as the second argument.</abstract>
      <description>The second argument is a regular expression that follows the Javascript
regular expression syntax.

The third argument is a string consisting of character flags to be used
by the match. If a character is present then that flag is true. The
flags are:
  g: global match - the submatches from all the matches in the string
                    are returned. If this character is not present, then
                    only the submatches from the first match in the
                    string are returned.
  i: case insensitive - the regular expression is treated as case
                        insensitive. If this character is not present,
                        then the regular expression is case sensitive.

The regexp:match function returns a node set of 'match' elements, each of
whose string value is equal to a portion of the first argument string
that was captured by the regular expression. If the match is not global,
the first match element has a value equal to the portion of the string
matched by the entire regular expression.</description>

    <function public="yes" name="Replace" id="Replace">
      <abstract>The regexp:replace function replaces the parts of a string that match
a regular expression with another string.</abstract>
      <description>The first argument is the string to be matched and replaced. The second
argument is a regular expression that follows the Javascript regular
expression syntax. The fourth argument is the string to replace the
matched parts of the string.

The third argument is a string consisting of character flags to be used
by the match. If a character is present then that flag is true. The flags
are:
  g: global replace - all occurrences of the regular expression in the
                      string are replaced. If this character is not
                      present, then only the first occurrence of the
                      regular expression is replaced.
  i: case insensitive - the regular expression is treated as case
                        insensitive. If this character is not present,
                        then the regular expression is case sensitive.</description>

    <function public="yes" name="Test" id="Test">
      <abstract>The regexp:test function returns true if the string given as the first
argument matches the regular expression given as the second argument.</abstract>
      <description>The second argument is a regular expression that follows the Javascript
regular expression syntax.

The third argument is a string consisting of flags to be used by the test.
If a character is present then that flag is true. The flags are:
  g: global test - has no effect on this function, but is retained for
                   consistency with regexp:match and regexp:replace.
  i: case insensitive - the regular expression is treated as case
                        insensitive. If this character is not present,
                        then the regular expression is case sensitive.</description>
