    <abstract>
      <para>This document provides step-by step instructions for users to
      obtain developmental versions of <trademark
      class="trade">4Suite</trademark> from the project's public CVS
      repository.</para>

      <para>4Suite is a Python-based toolkit for XML and RDF application
      development. It features a library of integrated tools for XML
      processing, implementing open technologies such as DOM, RDF, XSLT,
      XInclude, XPointer, XLink, XPath, XUpdate, RELAX NG, and XML/SGML
      Catalogs. Layered upon this is an XML and RDF data repository and
      server, which supports multiple methods of data access, query, indexing,
      transformation, rich linking, and rule processing, and provides the data
      infrastructure of a full database system, including transactions,
      concurrency, access control, and management tools. It also supports HTTP
      (including SOAP and WebDAV), RPC, FTP, and CORBA.</para>

    <title>Introduction and Conventions</title>

    <para>This document contains instructions for using CVS to keep up-to-date
    with the latest 4Suite source code. There is no guarantee that this code
    will be free of bugs, or that it will even build, so please consider it to
    be of strictly "alpha" quality.</para>

    <section>
      <title>About CVS</title>

      <para>CVS is a free, mature <emphasis role="bold">version control
      system</emphasis>: a client/server software system that developers use
      to store and track changes to source code. Fourthought maintains a CVS
      server that allows public access, so anyone can get the same code that
      the developers are using to test bug fixes &amp; feature enhancements
      for the next version of 4Suite.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Conventions</title>

      <para>Some command-line examples in this document may use
      "<computeroutput>$</computeroutput>" or something like
      "<computeroutput>C:\dev&gt;</computeroutput>" to represent the command
      shell prompt. The actual prompt varies from system to system, so please
      just consider them to be placeholders. And obviously, they aren't
      something that you're supposed to type.</para>

      <para>Some command-line examples in this document may use the text
      "SNIP" in place of a great deal of output from an instruction.</para>

    <title>Mailing Lists</title>

    <para>If you are going to be keeping up with 4Suite via CVS, then you
    should consider subscribing to the <ulink
    url="http://lists.fourthought.com/mailman/listinfo/4suite-dev">4suite-dev
    mailing list</ulink>. This is the mailing list on which the developers and
    other interested parties discuss issues pertaining to the development
    code, whereas the regular <ulink
    url="http://lists.fourthought.com/mailman/listinfo/4suite">4suite mailing
    list</ulink> is mainly for users of release versions.</para>

    <para>You may also want to know about the <ulink
    url="http://lists.fourthought.com/mailman/listinfo/4suite-checkins">4suite-checkins
    mailing list</ulink>. This read-only list announces each commit to the CVS
    repository as it is made. At times, it can be high volume, and not very
    interesting reading, but its <ulink
    url="http://lists.fourthought.com/pipermail/4suite-checkins/">archives</ulink>
    have proven useful for quickly locating diffs and patches.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Viewing the 4Suite CVS Repository on-line</title>

    <para>The 4Suite project CVS repository can be browsed on the web at
    <ulink
    url="http://cvs.4suite.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/4Suite/">http://cvs.4suite.org/</ulink>.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Prerequisite: a standard C compiler</title>

    <para>Before proceeding, please note that you need an ANSI/ISO C compiler
    in order to build 4Suite from source. This is not a problem for most Unix
    users, since gcc is now standard on most POSIX platforms, including most
    (if not all) Linux distributions, all of the BSDs, Mac OS X, and
    Cygwin.</para>

    <para>Windows, however, does not come with a C compiler; if you are on
    this platform, you must provide your own. 4Suite's developers usually use
    Microsoft <trademark class="registered">Visual C++ 6.0</trademark>. Other
    compilers are supported, but not widely tested. Please report any
    difficulties to the mailing list. After you have downloaded the 4Suite
    source code, you can invoke <userinput>setup.py
    --help-compilers</userinput> to see what compilers are supported.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Prerequisite: Python 2.2.1 or newer</title>

    <para>The development version of 4Suite will not work on versions of
    Python older than 2.2.1.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Obtaining the Source Code</title>

    <para>You have two options for obtaining the current 4Suite source
    code.</para>

    <para>One option (the one we recommend) is to download the source code
    with a <emphasis role="bold">CVS client</emphasis>. For an end user, the
    main advantage to using a CVS client is that you only download the
    complete source code once. Thereafter, you can use the client to easily
    download and automatically apply patches for only the files that have
    changed since your last update.</para>

    <para>The other option is to use anonymous FTP to get one of the nightly
    <emphasis role="bold">CVS snapshots</emphasis>. A snapshot is the complete
    source code in one standard .tar.gz file. A new snapshot is generated
    daily. The downside of getting a snapshot is that you have to download an
    entire snapshot each time you want to get an update, and it's difficult to
    tell what changed. Also, if you get a snapshot, you can't just switch to
    using a CVS client to get updates, because you need some special files
    that are created only the first time you get the code via a CVS
    client.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Getting a CVS Snapshot of the Source Code</title>

      <para>If you prefer to get a CVS snapshot, then this is all you need to
      do:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Get the latest snapshot at <ulink
          url="ftp://ftp.4suite.org/pub/cvs-snapshots/4Suite-CVS.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.4suite.org/pub/cvs-snapshots/4Suite-CVS.tar.gz</ulink>.
          Or, if you are specifically looking for an older snapshot, feel free
          to browse <ulink
          url="ftp://ftp.4suite.org/pub/cvs-snapshots/">ftp://ftp.4suite.org/pub/cvs-snapshots/</ulink>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Unzip the file somewhere. For example, on UNIX, the command
          <userinput>tar xzf 4Suite-CVS.tar.gz</userinput> should suffice.
          Windows users can use a third-party zip utility; the popular ones
          all support this format. Those who download with IE 5 may find that
          the filename loses its .gz extension, so be sure to correct the name
          before trying to unzip it.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Windows users, consult the <link linkend="building">Building
          4Suite on Windows</link> section of this document to see how to do
          the build.</para>

          <para>Everyone else, consult the <ulink url="UNIX.xml">Installing
          4Suite on UNIX</ulink> document.</para>

        <title>Quick Summary for Power Users (any platform)</title>

        <para>If you know your way around a CVS client, then here's a summary
        of the info you need:</para>

        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para>CVS host: <emphasis

            <para>CVS root: <emphasis
            role="bold">/var/local/cvsroot</emphasis></para>

            password)</emphasis></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The above translates to the CVSROOT <emphasis
        role="bold">:pserver:anonymous@cvs.4suite.org:/var/local/cvsroot</emphasis></para>

        <para>The module to checkout is: <emphasis
        role="bold">4Suite</emphasis></para>

        <para>For example, if you are using a command-line version of CVS
        (e.g. standard cvs on Unix or Cygwin, or CVSNT on Windows), simply run
        these commands from a shell prompt, pressing Enter when prompted for a
        password:</para>

        <para><userinput>cvs
        -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.4suite.org:/var/local/cvsroot
        login</userinput></para>

        <para><userinput>cvs
        -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.4suite.org:/var/local/cvsroot get
        4Suite</userinput></para>

        <para>A <computeroutput>4Suite</computeroutput> folder will be created
        in the current directory, and the source code will be downloaded into
        it.</para>

        <para>In the future, you can get the latest changes by simply running
        <userinput>cvs update -dP</userinput>.</para>

        <para>Next step: Windows users, consult the <link
        linkend="building">Building 4Suite on Windows</link> section of this

        <section>
          <title>Using Windows CVS clients to get 4Suite source code</title>

          <para>There are several very good CVS clients available for Windows.
          The sections below explain where to get and how to use the clients
          that the 4Suite developers recommend for Windows users. If you want
          to use a CVS client to download 4Suite, then please pick a client
          from the list below and follow the appropriate instructions.</para>

                <para>In Windows Explorer, navigate to a location where you'd

              <listitem>
                <para>At this point, you may wish to familiarize yourself with
                TortoiseCVS and adjust its configuration a bit.</para>

                <para>Right-click in the Explorer window somewhere, not on a
                file. On the context menu, navigate to CVS and then to
                Preferences. A TortoiseCVS Preferences dialog will open. In
                this dialog, there are a couple of things you'll probably want
                to change. None of these changes are absolutely necessary, but
                they are recommended.</para>

                <itemizedlist>
                  <listitem>
                    <para>Pick visually pleasing overlay icons. Click on the
                    first "Browse" button in the "Main" tab and pick an
                    overlay set that you like. Your 4Suite source code files
                    will have these overlays on their icons, and chances are,
                    the default overlays are not what you'd prefer.
                    TortoiseCVS will say that you need to reboot to see the
                    new icons, but if you know how to kill the Explorer
                    process and start a new Explorer from the Task Manager,
                    you can just do that.</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>
                    <para>If you typically edit text files in something other
                    than Notepad, and especially if there's a chance that
                    you'll be submitting patches to the developers, then do
                    the following: In the "Advanced" tab of the preferences
                    dialog, set "Unix line endings", and unset "Check not Unix
                    sandbox". This ensures that the text files you download
                    with TortoiseCVS will contain single-character newlines
                    (LF, rather than CR+LF), which is the convention the
                    developers use.</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>
                    <para>You might want to install a diff application
                    (something that shows the differences between two text
                    files), so that you can compare different versions of
                    files. The FAQ on the TortoiseCVS site has
                    recommendations. Configure TortoiseCVS to use the one you
                    installed by entering the path to the appropriate file in
                    the "External diff application" box on the "Main" tab of
                    the preferences dialog.</para>
                  </listitem>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Now you can do the checkout. Don't worry —"checkout" is
                CVS's terminology for "download a copy". It's not like other
                version control systems where the server marks files as being
                checked out by you and uneditable by others.</para>

                <para>Right-click in the Explorer window somewhere, not on a
                file. On the context menu, pick "CVS Checkout...". The
                Checkout Module dialog will appear.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>In the Checkout Module dialog's "Module" tab, enter the
                following in the CVSROOT box:</para>

                <para><userinput>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.4suite.org:/var/local/cvsroot</userinput></para>

                <para>In the "Module" box at the bottom, enter "4Suite". Be
                sure to capitalize the S in 4Suite. You don't need to set
                anything in the other tabs, but you might want to look at them
                to see what is in them, for future reference. Click the "OK"

          <listitem>
            <para>Although obtaining the source code with CVS is relatively
            painless, when building on Cygwin, there are several prerequisites
            and package incompatibilities to watch out for. For now, these are

            The <computeroutput>cvs</computeroutput> package is available from
            the 'devel' section of the Cygwin installer (setup.exe). You can

    <para>As mentioned above, you need a C compiler. You also need:</para>

    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>An appropriate version of Python (2.2.1 or higher). If PyXML is
        not installed, your Python must have pyexpat and expat support
        compiled in. This is usually not a problem, but occasionally, people
        don't have it.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>An appropriate version of PyXML, if you want to use it (it's not
        a prerequisite). Acceptable PyXML versions are 0.7.1 or higher, with
        0.8.2 or higher recommended. Avoid 0.8.1, which causes crashes. Also,
        if you are going to install PyXML, but haven't yet, it is recommended
        that you use the <userinput>--without-xpath</userinput> and
        <userinput>--without-xslt</userinput> options when running PyXML's
        setup.py.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Ensure that your C compiler executables are in your PATH and will
    run from the command line. The default compiler assumed by the installer
    is MS Visual C++, which uses the executable
    <computeroutput>cl.exe</computeroutput>. This compiler happens to require
    LIB and INCLUDE environment variables be set to point to MSVC's
    <computeroutput>Lib</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>Include
    directories</computeroutput>, respectively. Other compilers may have
    different requirements.</para>

    <para>You can specify a different compiler by passing an appropriate
    <userinput>--compiler=<replaceable>compilerID</replaceable></userinput>
    argument to 4Suite's setup.py. To see what other compilers are supported,
    change to the directory where the source code was downloaded, e.g.
    <computeroutput>C:\dev\4Suite</computeroutput>, and run <userinput>python
    setup.py --help-compilers</userinput>.</para>

    <para>Once you have the compiler ready, all you have to do is this:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Ensure that you don't already have a 4ssd instance

      <listitem>
        <para>Run <userinput>python setup.py install</userinput>.</para>

        <para>If you got the source with a CVS client, then the installer will
        detect that you are in 'developer mode' due to the presence of CVS
        directories, and will turn off verbose output by default. This
        non-verbose output, which can be enforced by passing the
        <userinput>-q</userinput> flag to setup.py, will look like the
        following, if all goes well:</para>

        <para>If in developer mode, in order to build with verbose output

        <computeroutput>C:\Python23\Lib\site-packages</computeroutput>,
        depending on the version of Python in use. You can specify a different
        base directory by passing the
        <userinput>--root=<replaceable>otherDirectory</replaceable></userinput>
        option to the install command, e.g. <userinput>python setup.py install

      <listitem>
        <para>The last thing to do is to set your PATH environment variable so
        that the 4Suite command-line tools can be run from anywhere. The place
        where you configure the path varies with each version of Windows, but
        is generally available through the System control panel. Right-click
        on My Computer on the desktop and choose Properties to jump straight
        to the control panel, and then navigate to the environment variable
        section from there.</para>

        <para>The path to add, as of 4Suite 1.0a4, is
        <computeroutput>{PYTHONHOME}\Scripts</computeroutput>. So for a
        typical Python 2.3 install, you would want to add
        <userinput>C:\Python23\Scripts</userinput> to your PATH. <emphasis
        role="bold">Note: This location is different than it was in all
        versions of 4Suite through 1.0a3</emphasis>. So if you are upgrading,
        remove the old <computeroutput>{PYTHONHOME or
        site-packages}\Ft\Share\Bin</computeroutput> directory from your
        PATH.</para>

        <para>Alternatively, you could just copy the files from the Scripts

      <para>If all you wish to use in 4Suite are the basic command-line tools
      and Python libraries, then you are done with installation and can
      proceed to use them. To make sure things are working, try running a few

      <para>More thorough regression test suites for the 4Suite Python
      libraries are included with 4Suite, and you are welcome to try them out.
      Ideally, in a regular release version of 4Suite, they should all run to
      completion without errors. Warnings are OK. In alpha and beta versions
      or CVS snapshots, some errors are to be expected, and do not need to be
      reported unless the tests cannot even run to completion.</para>

      <para>Be prepared for a lot of output. Omit the
      <computeroutput>-v</computeroutput> if you want somewhat less detail.
      You can also specify certain tests by appending the relative path to a
      subdirectory or .py file.</para>

      <para>If you want to use the XML/RDF repository and server features of
      4Suite, then you will need to customize and install a configuration
      file, initialize a repository, and do some further tests. These topics
