	CHANGE-REQUEST
	
	The CHANGE-REQUEST attribute is used by the client to request that

	response.  The attribute is 32 bits long, although only two bits (A
	and B) are used:
	
	 0                   1                   2                   3

	The meaning of the flags is:
	
	A: This is the "change IP" flag.  If true, it requests the server
	   to send the Binding Response with a different IP address than the
	   one the Binding Request was received on.

	The MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute contains an HMAC-SHA1 [13] of the
	STUN message.  It can be present in Binding Requests or Binding
	Responses.  Since it uses the SHA1 hash, the HMAC will be 20 bytes.
	The text used as input to HMAC is the STUN message, including the
	header, up to and including the attribute preceding the MESSAGE-
	INTEGRITY attribute. That text is then padded with zeroes so as to be
	a multiple of 64 bytes.  As a result, the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute
	MUST be the last attribute in any STUN message.  The key used as
	input to HMAC depends on the context.

class StunErrorCodeAttribute(StunAttribute):
	'''
	ERROR-CODE
	
	The ERROR-CODE attribute is present in the Binding Error Response and
	Shared Secret Error Response.  It is a numeric value in the range of
	100 to 699 plus a textual reason phrase encoded in UTF-8, and is
	consistent in its code assignments and semantics with SIP [10] and
	HTTP [15].  The reason phrase is meant for user consumption, and can
	be anything appropriate for the response code.  The lengths of the
	reason phrases MUST be a multiple of 4 (measured in bytes).  This can
	be accomplished by added spaces to the end of the text, if necessary.
	Recommended reason phrases for the defined response codes are
	presented below.
	
	To facilitate processing, the class of the error code (the hundreds
	digit) is encoded separately from the rest of the code.
	
	  0                   1                   2                   3

	The class represents the hundreds digit of the response code.  The
	value MUST be between 1 and 6.  The number represents the response
	code modulo 100, and its value MUST be between 0 and 99.
	
	The following response codes, along with their recommended reason
	phrases (in brackets) are defined at this time:
	
	400 (Bad Request): The request was malformed.  The client should not
		 retry the request without modification from the previous
		 attempt.
	
	401 (Unauthorized): The Binding Request did not contain a MESSAGE-
		 INTEGRITY attribute.
	
	420 (Unknown Attribute): The server did not understand a mandatory
		 attribute in the request.
	
	430 (Stale Credentials): The Binding Request did contain a MESSAGE-
		 INTEGRITY attribute, but it used a shared secret that has
		 expired.  The client should obtain a new shared secret and try
		 again.
	
	431 (Integrity Check Failure): The Binding Request contained a
		 MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute, but the HMAC failed verification.
		 This could be a sign of a potential attack, or client
		 implementation error.
	
	432 (Missing Username): The Binding Request contained a MESSAGE-
		 INTEGRITY attribute, but not a USERNAME attribute.  Both must be
		 present for integrity checks.
	
	433 (Use TLS): The Shared Secret request has to be sent over TLS, but
		 was not received over TLS.
	
	500 (Server Error): The server has suffered a temporary error. The
		 client should try again.
	
	600 (Global Failure:) The server is refusing to fulfill the request.
		 The client should not retry.
