class Generator:
	'''
	Generators generate data.  Examples of generators could be a static
	string or integer, a string repeater, etc.  Generators can be "incremented"
	by calling C{next()} to produce the next varient of data.  Generators can
	be fairly complex, comainting sub-generators to build things like packets.
	
	Generators support the interator protocol and can be used as such.
	
	When building a Generator one should keep in mind that the value from a
	generator could be asked for more then once per "round".  Also it is
	recommended that you use the default C{getValue()} implementation and override
	the C{getRawValue()} method instead.
