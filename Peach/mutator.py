Mutator base classes and interfaces.

A Mutator implements a method of mutating data/state for a Peach 2
fuzzer.  For example a mutator might change the state flow defined
by a Peach fuzzer.  Another mutator might mutate data based on
known relationships.  Another mutator might perform numerical type
tests against fields.
