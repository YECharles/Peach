	'''
	Publisher for ODBC connections.  Generated data sent as a SQL query via
	execute.  Calling receave will return a string of all row data concatenated
	together with \t as field separator.
	
	Currently this Publisher makes use of the odbc package which is some what
	broken in that you must create an actual ODBC DSN via the ODBC manager.  
	Check out mxODBC which is not open source for another alterative.
	
	Note:  Each call to start/stop will create and close the SQL connection and
	cursor.
