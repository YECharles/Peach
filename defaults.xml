	This is the configuration file for this Peach instance. This file
	should setup the proper paths to indicate were Peach is located
	and also import the standard modules.
	
	All Peach XML files should include this file using the following syntax:
	
	   <Include ns="default" src="file:defaults.xml" />
	
	NOTE: Do *NOT* package this file along with templates when distributing
	      them.  This file is intended to already exist with every Peach
		  install/instance!

	<!--
	
	Adding other imports or includes to this file is probably not a good idea.
	
	If you have defaults used by several templates its better to place them in
	a separate file that can be included by those templates.  This will make
	it easier to package up and re-use the templates else-were.
